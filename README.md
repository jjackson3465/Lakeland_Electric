Original data obtained from Lakeland Electric can be found in the 'load_files', 'moodey_files', and 'weather_files' folders
  - Moodey data was cleaned and explored but not ultimately used
  - EDA.ipynb and Data_exploration_SAM_INFO.ipynb were the exploratory notebooks and used for a lot of the file creations
  - prophet.ipynb was an early notebook that attempted to utilized Facebook's Prophet model for time series analysis
    
research_model.ipynb contains all of the models ultimately used with the exception of Random-Forest which Maria will need to provide.
